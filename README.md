## Features

- Data loading and exploration using pandas
- Basic statistical analysis
- Four different types of visualizations:
  - Line chart of sepal length patterns
  - Bar chart of average petal lengths by species
  - Histogram of sepal width distribution
  - Scatter plot of sepal length vs petal length

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook assign7/data_analysis.ipynb
```

## Analysis Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**

   - Loads the Iris dataset
   - Displays basic dataset information
   - Shows summary statistics

2. **Basic Data Analysis**

   - Calculates means by species
   - Checks for missing values
   - Groups data by categories

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Creates multiple visualizations to understand data patterns
   - Includes customized plots with proper labels and legends

## Key Findings

- Dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features
- No missing values in the dataset
- Clear separation between Setosa and other species
- Significant variation in petal length across species
- Normal distribution of sepal width measurements
